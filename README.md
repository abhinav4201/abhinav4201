Hi there, I'm Abhinav 👋
I'm a Biotech Engineer who transitioned into the world of technology, blending a scientific, analytical mindset with a passion for building clean, user-centric applications. My journey has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving, whether I'm analyzing a dataset or crafting a pixel-perfect UI.

🔬 From the Lab: My background in science taught me precision, patience, and a data-first approach.

💻 To the Keyboard: I now apply that rigor to Frontend Development and Data Science, creating solutions that are both functional and insightful.

🌱 I’m always learning and currently diving deeper into machine learning models and cloud deployment.

📫 You can reach me at abhinav445.aa@gmail.com.
