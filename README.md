👨‍🔬 My Journey: From Lab Bench to Code Editor
My career began in the world of Biotechnology, where I developed a meticulous, analytical, and data-driven mindset. This foundation in scientific inquiry sparked a passion for uncovering hidden patterns, which naturally led me to the fascinating fields of Data Science and Machine Learning.

Today, I channel that same precision and problem-solving spirit into Frontend Development, crafting clean, intuitive, and impactful digital experiences. I believe the best solutions are born at the intersection of analytical rigor and creative design.

🌱 I’m currently deepening my understanding of neural networks and exploring backend technologies.
